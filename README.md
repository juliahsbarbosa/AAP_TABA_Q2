# Algorithms and Advanced Programming Assignment

2. Suppose that the following task is assigned to you to complete as efficiently as possible.
There are five countries in Europe labeled C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. C1 is represented as country[0], C2
as country[1]â€¦, C5 as country[4] in a country multidimensional array. Each country containing
10,000 records (The Java code that generates the data for each country is provided to you on
Moodle page along with this question). You are required to compute the sum, average,
maximum and minimum of the data contained in each country.
A. Write a multithreaded program that takes the data from each country (country[0] -
country[4]) and compute the total, mean, max and min of the data using 5 separate
threads.
B. Write a program that combines the statistics computed from each thread above (Q2.a)
and present the grand total, average, maximum and minimum of all the countries.
